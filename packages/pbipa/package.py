    Improved Phased Assembler (IPA)üç∫ is the official PacBio software for HiFi genome assembly.
    IPA was designed to utilize the accuracy of PacBio HiFi reads to produce high-quality phased genome assemblies.
    IPA is an end-to-end solution, starting with input reads and resulting in a polished assembly.
    IPA is fast, providing an easy to use local run mode or a distributed pipeline for a cluster.
