    """Aberrant R package from https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~spencer/Aberrant/

    Aberrant is a super useful R package but it seems to no longer be available in CRAN. I am not the author of this software; rather, this is a mirror.

    When I use this package, I cite the following paper: Bellenguez, C. et al. A robust clustering algorithm for identifying problematic samples in genome-wide association studies. Bioinformatics 28, 134â€“135 (2012). PMID 22057162.
